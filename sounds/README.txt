This project includes a few royalty-free samples (e.g. metronome clicks and 808/909) from:
https://freewavesamples.com/korg-n1r-metronome-click

The main source of royalty-free samples is the marvelous FreePats packs at:
General MIDI https://freepats.zenvoid.org/SoundSets/general-midi.html

Missing instruments were extracted from the samples of an old app called OpenMetronome:

Dear reader, if you stumbled upon this project and feel that there are samples that cannot be
re-used, please let me know. One objective of this app is to include a vast set of default sounds.
